This repository contains an example of a common error in Rust programming related to the unsafe use of raw pointers. The bug.rs file demonstrates the problematic code, which modifies a value via a raw pointer without accounting for potential issues like memory reallocation. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The bugSolution.rs file shows how to avoid this error and achieve safe memory management.
